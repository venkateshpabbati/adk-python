"""Dev-only endpoints that deploy the current agent from the developer UI.

Supports the three hosted targets `adk deploy` offers: Agent Runtime,
Cloud Run and GKE.

Registered by `DevServer` and never by `ApiServer`. Deploying builds an image
from the agent source and pushes it using the developer's cloud credentials, so
these routes must not exist in a deployed container. That guarantee is
structural rather than a runtime check: the generated Dockerfile deletes
`dev_server.py` from the image (see `deployers/_dockerfile_template.py`), so a
deployed agent has no way to reach this module.

Each deploy runs as a child `adk deploy <target>` process instead of by
importing `cli_deploy` and calling it. That is not a stylistic choice:
`cli_deploy.to_agent_engine` calls `os.chdir()` twice (it documents that Agent
Runtime deployment uses relative paths). Working directory is process-global,
so running it inside the server would corrupt the cwd of every other request
for the several minutes a deploy takes. A child process gives it a cwd of its
own.

The `agent_engine` spelling survives in route paths, request fields and flags
because those name real CLI surface: the `adk deploy agent_engine` subcommand
and its `--agent_engine_id` flag. Prose calls the product Agent Runtime.
