  """Holds one value per event loop for a single attribute of a single owner.

  An async client holds sockets, locks and tasks that belong to the event loop
  that was running when they were opened. Caching such a client once for the
  lifetime of its owner therefore breaks as soon as a second loop uses it: the
  second loop reaches into a loop that has already been closed. Owners outlive
  loops routinely -- the synchronous runner entry points run each call in a new
  loop, and servers that dispatch requests to a thread pool do the same.

  Values are keyed weakly by the running loop, so every loop builds its own and
  an entry vanishes once its loop is collected, whether or not that loop was
  ever closed. Reading a value for a new loop additionally discards the entries
  whose loop reports itself closed, which releases the value promptly for a
  closed loop that something else still holds. Reads with no loop running share
  a single entry, which is never discarded. Sharing that one entry is safe
  because a reader with no loop running goes on to use the synchronous surface,
  which has no loop affinity. A caller that instead read the value off-loop and
  drove it from a loop would keep using it after that loop closed, since this
  is the one key the sweep never reaches.

  Keying weakly on the loop object is safe against address reuse. A lookup hits
  only when the stored key both hashes equal to and compares equal to the key
  being looked up, and a ``weakref.ref`` whose referent has died compares equal
  to nothing but itself. A reference to a new loop that happens to land on a
  collected loop's address is therefore a miss even though the two addresses,
  and so the two hashes, agree. The reference's own callback has usually
  dropped the entry by then in any case.

    Like ``cached_property`` this defines no ``__set__``, so assigning over the

    attribute first, and deleting an assigned value uncovers the descriptor
    rather than clearing what it has cached.
