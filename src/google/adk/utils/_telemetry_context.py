# Internal context variable for caller-surface telemetry attribution.
# Read at BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin construction time (or on the default
# per-instance shared loop, if unset at construction, when the loop state is
# first built and pinned for that (plugin, loop) pair thereafter), and by
# ``integrations.bigquery.client.get_bigquery_client`` and
# ``get_dataplex_catalog_client`` (via ``_get_telemetry_surface()`` /
# ``_surface_user_agent()``) at client construction time. When set
# (e.g. "my-surface"), the plugin stamps
# ``google-adk-bq-logger-{surface}/{version}`` into the BigQuery Write API
# ``trace_id`` (taking precedence over ``_is_visual_builder``) and both the
# plugin and the BigQuery/Dataplex client factories stamp
# ``google-adk-{surface}/{version}`` into the client/gRPC user agent.
# Callers are responsible for passing a clean token matching
# ``[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?`` (no spaces/colons; avoid ``"bq-logger"``,
# ``"java"``, and ``"visual-builder"``, which already occupy the namespace).
# The value must also stay constant for the lifetime of any plugin instance
# constructed while it is set (and across lazy tool client creation during
# agent execution): the plugin captures it at ``__init__``, and
# on a shared loop, if ``__init__`` captured nothing, ``_build_loop_state``
# pins whatever is visible when the loop state is first built. Flipping the
# value mid-flight does not re-attribute an already-built writer.
