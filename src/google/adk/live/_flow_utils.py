  A live run starts two kinds of tools as bare asyncio tasks: streaming
  tools (``active_streaming_tools``) and non-blocking tools
  (``active_non_blocking_tool_tasks``). Nothing tied either to the lifetime
  of the run that started it — only an explicit ``stop_streaming`` call ever
  cancelled one — so a tool kept running after its agent was done, feeding
  function responses into a live request queue that by then belonged to
  another agent, or to nobody at all.

  The tools stop when the run that started them ends, whether that is a
  handoff to another agent, ``task_completed``, the connection closing, or
  the caller walking away. Tying this to the agent run rather than to the
  whole invocation is what keeps a tool from reaching the model of the
  agent that comes after it.

  Cancellation is best effort: a task that does not stop within
  ``_TOOL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` is logged and left behind rather than
  stalling the handoff or the caller's teardown on it.
