"""Checks that newly-added Python files under src/google/adk/ follow conventions.

ADK conventions enforced for newly-added Python files:
1. Private-by-default: Newly-added Python files under src/google/adk/ must
   have a '_'-prefixed basename. To expose public symbols, export them via the
   subpackage __init__.py / __all__.
   See .agents/skills/adk-style/references/visibility.md.
2. Unit guide requirement: Newly-added Python files under src/google/adk/ must
   have a corresponding unit guide in docs/guides/ (unless exempt or tagged with
   NO_UNIT_GUIDE / SKIP_UNIT_GUIDE in the commit message or environment).
   See .agents/skills/adk-unit-guide/SKILL.md.

Either rule can be switched off on its own, with --no-prefix-check and
--no-unit-guide. The two are gated by separate CI jobs for that reason: the
unit guide rule is waivable per change and the prefix rule is not, so whatever
waives one must not quietly disable the other.

Modes for finding added files:
- Baseline Diff Mode (CI):
    python scripts/check_new_py_files.py --baseline-dir /path/to/origin-main
- VCS Detection Mode (Local / Pre-commit):
    python scripts/check_new_py_files.py
- Explicit File List:
    python scripts/check_new_py_files.py file1.py file2.py
- File List From A File (CI, where the list can outgrow a command line):
    python scripts/check_new_py_files.py --added-files-from added.txt

Exit codes: 0 = ok, 1 = violation(s) found, 2 = usage/setup error,
3 = indeterminate (the set of added files could not be resolved at all).

Exit code 3 exists so that "could not determine the added files" cannot be
read as "no violations". A caller that runs this opportunistically, such as
the pre-commit hook, can report it as skipped; a caller that relies on it to
gate a change passes --baseline-dir or --added-files-from and never sees it.
