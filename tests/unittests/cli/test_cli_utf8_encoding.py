"""Tests that the CLI reads and writes text files as UTF-8.

`open()` without an explicit `encoding` uses the platform's locale encoding,
which is not UTF-8 on a large share of Windows installs (`cp936` for zh-CN,
`cp932` for ja-JP, `cp1252` for much of the West). The CLI's JSON and Markdown
files carry agent prompts, model responses and display names, so they routinely
hold non-ASCII text -- and JSON is defined as UTF-8 for interchange (RFC 8259
§8.1). Reading those files under a non-UTF-8 locale either raises
`UnicodeDecodeError` or, when the UTF-8 bytes happen to form a valid sequence in
the locale codec, silently yields mojibake.

CI runs on a UTF-8 default, so a test that merely reads a UTF-8 file cannot
catch a missing `encoding=`. `_non_utf8_default_locale` therefore simulates the
locale by forcing a non-UTF-8 codec onto every `open()` call that omits
`encoding`, which makes these tests fail on any platform if the argument is
dropped again.
